# Hello world :smile:

My name is Piotr Boguslawski and I'am a software developer with 30 years of practice.

On this blog I will be posting various curiosities and tips for programming in different languages, on different platforms and using a variety of technologies.

Currently I am in the process of exploring [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin) and [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms) technologies, which allow you to create applications for iOS, Android, MacOS and Windows in C# programming language and give you the ability to share the same source code between so many platforms in a really big way.

If these technologies evolve (it's never certain when Microsoft is behind a project :smirk:), it should really revolutionize mobile and non-mobile application writing because it speeds things up several times.

So far I like it, although Xamarin.Forms is, in my opinion, unnecessarily complicated in some modules.

We'll see what happens...

I invite you to work together on my projects exploiting the aforementioned technologies. By writing a fairly large and useful application and various libraries we can learn a lot and have a lot of fun. Much more than studying examples...
