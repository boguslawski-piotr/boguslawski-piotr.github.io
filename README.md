#### A simple application to store all kinds of notes, which can be organized in notebooks and pages.

Notebooks, pages and notes can be encrypted. 

Access to the application can be protected both using system security (Apple TouchID, various fingerprint readers on Android devices, Windows Hello, etc.) as well as using an internal pin.

All of the above security techniques can be combined. :smile:

The application is written in C# and uses [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin) and [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms) technologies, and also uses my own library [pbX](https://github.com/boguslawski-piotr/pbX) and it's like an example application for it.

The whole project (app and all libraries) is based on the philosophy of open source and I sincerely invite you to jointly develop it.

## [pbX](https://github.com/boguslawski-piotr/pbX)

C# libraries for [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin) and [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms).
